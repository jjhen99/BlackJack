# BlackJack
The original author of this is from https://kevinsguides.com/guides/code/java/javaprojs/consoleblackjack#completed.

Please give credit to the original author I have simply followed the guide so I can learn more about Java and OOP.

This was a lot harder than expected and involves a lot of coding. In the future I may add my own features such as betting money. I may even look into using a GUI.
